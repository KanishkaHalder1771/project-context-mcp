    1. Overview
We will build a landing website that allows users to join a waitlist and contact the developers. The system will include:

A Frontend service for UI rendering.

An Auth service for user authentication.

A Communication service for waitlist and contact form management.

All services will reside in a single Next.js application but structured as separate modules using routes and components.

2. Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: Next.js (with App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Authentication: Firebase Authentication

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Email Service: SendGrid

Deployment: Vercel

State Management: React Context (for session and global UI state)

3. System Architecture
The system will follow a modular approach:

Frontend Service:

Pages: Landing page, navigation to Auth and Contact pages.

Handles UI for waitlist form and links to Auth/Contact pages.

Submits data via Next.js API routes to backend services.

Auth Service:

API Routes: /api/auth/login, /api/auth/signup

Uses Firebase Authentication for user login/signup.

Generates and verifies Firebase JWT tokens.

Login and Signup pages integrated in frontend.

Communication Service:

API Routes:

/api/communication/waitlist → Save waitlist entries to Supabase.

/api/communication/contact → Save contact messages to Supabase and send email via SendGrid.

Contact page for user message submissions.

Server-side validation for all forms.

4. Data Flow
Waitlist:

User submits name + email → API route → Supabase table waitlist.

Contact:

User submits message → API route → Save to Supabase table contacts → Trigger SendGrid email to developers.

Auth:

User signs up or logs in → Firebase issues JWT → Stored in HttpOnly cookie for session management.

Protected routes verify token via Firebase Admin SDK in API routes.

5. Folder Structure

/app
  /landing        -> Landing page components
  /auth           -> Login & Signup pages
  /contact        -> Contact form page
/api
  /auth

/lib
  firebase.ts     -> Firebase config
  supabase.ts     -> Supabase client
  sendgrid.ts     -> Email service helper
/components       -> UI components
6. Deployment
Vercel will handle deployment and CI/CD.

Environment variables for Firebase, Supabase, and SendGrid will be managed in Vercel’s dashboard.

7. Security
JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS.

API routes will validate input and check authentication when required.

Supabase service keys are server-side only.
    """
    convo2 = """We will also introduce a dedicated Go-based worker service as part of the system architecture. This worker will handle background tasks that need to run asynchronously, separate from the main application flow. For example, when a user signs up for the waitlist through the frontend application, their information will be recorded in the database. At that point, the Go worker will pick up a background verification job from a task queue or event trigger. This job may include verifying the user’s details, performing any required checks, or enriching their profile data.

Once the background verification process is complete, the worker will update the Supabase database with the user’s verification status and any additional details obtained during the process. This ensures that the frontend can always display the latest status to the user without blocking their initial signup experience. By offloading these tasks to the Go worker, we keep the user experience fast and responsive while maintaining a reliable and scalable verification process.
