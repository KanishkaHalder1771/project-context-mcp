Redis Integration Decision for Project-Context MCP

DECISION:
The project-context MCP system will now integrate Redis as a core component.

CONTEXT:
This decision follows previous discussions about implementing a Go-based worker service architecture for background task processing. Redis will likely serve as the message queue/task queue component in the system architecture.

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Redis will be used as the message queue solution for the Go worker service
- Supports the task queue + worker pattern discussed earlier
- Will handle job queuing for background verification tasks
- Enables asynchronous processing separate from main application flow

TECHNICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Need to add Redis client dependencies to the project
- Redis connection configuration required
- Job serialization/deserialization logic needed
- Queue monitoring and management capabilities
- Integration with existing context management system

ARCHITECTURE FIT:
Redis fits well with the previously discussed architecture:
Frontend → API → Database + Redis Queue → Go Worker → Database Update

This decision establishes Redis as the chosen message queue solution over other options like RabbitMQ or PostgreSQL-based queuing that were previously considered.
